# Water_Quality_Dataset
Here we are predict the water quality level in water and it is a supervised machine learning algorithm use in this dataset.

* Business Case:-
Here we are predict the water quality level in water and decied the based on different column in this dataset like
aluminium, ammonia, arsenic	, barium, cadmium, chloramine, chromium,copper,	flouride, bacteria, viruses	,lead, nitrates, nitrites, mercury,	perchlorate, radium, selenium ,silver ,uranium ,is_safe.

* Final Usecase:-
  Here we can are use the total 10 algorithm in this dataset like Logistic Regression, SVM Algorithm, DecisionTreeClassifier,
KNN ALgorithm, Bagging Algorithm, RandomForestClassifier, GradiantBoostingClassifier, XGBClassifierAddaBoostingClassifier, ANN_MLPClassifier.
  Here we can see the Highest model accuracy_score provide XGBClassifier Algorithm is 96.35 and f1_score is 96.35.
Here we can see the Highest model accuracy_score provide DecisionTree Algorithm is 94.40 and f1_score is 94.57.
